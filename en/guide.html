            AUSM or All Universal Shopping Mall is a dimension of what consists of infinitely large number of shopping malls, what were moved to this dimenension at same time from varius timelines in our reality, and hence AUSM malls (in-universe one single mall called "structure") count is equal to the number of all possible outcomes in the history, however structures what are placed near each other tend to be from similar timelines with differences close to minimal.
            Two main principles of the setting:
            1) As long as shelves are not destroyer they restook goods they have every day at 12:00 AM. Shelves can be repaired before critical amount of damage without canceling their effect.
            2) People in AUSM has significantly stronger regeneration - essentaly, they are immortal. However, the regeneration follows the "minimal" principle - the regeneration doesn't work when there is no place for new body parts and/or there is comfict between body dna, bodily fluids and augmentations then regeneration doesn't work.
            In a nutshell, AUSM is a setting of immortal people in endless mall with infinity amount of goods and the utter absurdity that this leads to.
